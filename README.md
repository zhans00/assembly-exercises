Some exercises in MIPS language

#1 
  `Computes the first seven values of the fibonacci sequence and store those values in memory`
#2
  `Given an array of integers "Arr", its length, integers x and y, replace all x's with y in Arr`
#3
  `Given a string S and its length, reverse S`
#4 
  `Given a string S and its length, sort S`
#5
  `Prompt the user for two integers and print out the sum of these integers to the console.
   Return error message in case of overflow`
#6
  `Implement a recursive procedure pow that takes two integers, base and exponent, and returns base^exponent`
#7 
  `Implement a procedure circleRainbow in MIPS assembly language that draws a circle.
  The procedure takes the x and y coordinates of the center of circle (in $a0 and $a1),
  the radius (in $a2), and
  the color of circle (in $a3) as inputs`
#8
  `Implement a procedure cosine that, given a value x
   in radian, approximates cos(x) using the Taylor expansion`
